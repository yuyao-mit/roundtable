Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable potential in a wide range of scientific tasks, including prediction and generative analyses. However, it remains challenging for a single model to excel at all tasks simultaneously‚Äîsome LLMs specialize in prediction accuracy while others are more adept at generating coherent, context-rich text. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-LLM agent framework for perovskite solar cell property prediction and decision-making. In our approach, multiple LLMs‚Äîeach treated as an independent ‚Äúexpert‚Äù‚Äîare trained on the same multimodal dataset but leverage their unique strengths to produce diverse outputs. These outputs are then integrated through a ‚Äúroundtable discussion,‚Äù where an aggregator or ‚Äújudge‚Äù model (or a human operator) compiles, compares, and merges each expert‚Äôs input. By employing techniques such as majority voting and weighted consensus, the final decision is informed by the collective wisdom of all experts. We demonstrate that this ensemble strategy outperforms single-model baselines on both predictive and generative tasks, with a particular focus on key perovskite solar cell parameters. This framework is not only simple and efficient to implement‚Äîrequiring primarily CSV-based data preprocessing and straightforward aggregator logic‚Äîbut also highly adaptable to broader materials discovery and design challenges, thereby paving the way for future integration into more complex automated research systems.

## Benchmark

To prevent benchmark data contamination, we only provide the annotation sheet on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osunlp/ScienceAgentBench), which includes all necessary *inputs* to run an agent.

To evaluate the agent outcomes, i.e. generated code, please download the full benchmark [here](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chen_8336_buckeyemail_osu_edu/EQuA6uJ3CtRHvRfZ2GiN1tYBRVJE4DSUD10MW61fr7HuSQ?e=sCBegG) and unzip it with password `scienceagentbench`.
