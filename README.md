Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable potential across various scientific domains, including predictive modeling and generative analysis. However, no single LLM excels across all tasks‚Äîsome are optimized for high-precision numerical predictions, while others specialize in generating coherent, context-rich text.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce **Roundtable Policy**, a multi-LLM agent framework designed for scientific discovery and proposal generation. Our approach is centered around two key components:

- **Arbitrator** ‚Äì An intelligent aggregator that systematically integrates model outputs.
- **Confidence Weight Table** ‚Äì A dynamic, trainable mechanism that optimally weights contributions from different expert models.

### Framework & Implementation

In our framework, multiple LLMs function as independent ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù each trained on the same multimodal dataset while leveraging their specialized capabilities to generate diverse outputs. These responses undergo a **roundtable discussion**, where the **Arbitrator** compiles, compares, and integrates each expert‚Äôs insights. The final decision is then refined using the **Confidence Weight Table**, ensuring optimal fusion of expertise.

Unlike traditional LLM pipelines that rely heavily on extensive parameter tuning, our **Confidence Weight Table** is computationally lightweight yet trainable, allowing for rapid adaptation to new tasks while maintaining high performance.

### Benchmarking & Results

To evaluate our framework, we benchmarked it against single-model baselines on perovskite solar cell property prediction and decision-making tasks. Our ensemble approach consistently outperforms single-model baselines across both predictive and generative tasks. Additionally, it achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple input modalities, demonstrating superior robustness and adaptability in scientific applications.

## Quick Setup

Below are the general steps to get started with Roundtable Policy on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuyao-mit/roundtable.git
   cd roundtable
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**  
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.  
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Some external dependencies, like `rasterio` or `matminer`, may require platform-specific installation steps. Please consult their official documentation for further guidance.

3. **Download or link the dataset**  
   - The primary dataset is provided on the [Project Page][project-page].  
   - Place or symlink the dataset in the `data/` directory (or update the path in `config.yaml` if you prefer a custom location).

4. **Run a simple demo**  
   - Modify the config file (`config.yaml` or a Python-based config script) to point to your data location and desired parameters.  
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     python main.py --config config.yaml
     ```
   - The demo will showcase how multiple LLM ‚Äúexperts‚Äù generate and compare their predictions, with the **Arbitrator** and **Confidence Weight Table** finalizing results.

5. **Evaluate model performance**  
   - Use the evaluation script to compare single-model baselines vs. the Roundtable Policy pipeline:
     ```bash
     python evaluate.py --config config.yaml
     ```
   - Results will be saved in `results/` by default, summarizing both predictive and generative benchmarks.
